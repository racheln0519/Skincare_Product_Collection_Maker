## Skincare Product Collection Creator


**A brief description**

As an individual with strong interests in skincare, I want to design an application where users can input products to a 
collection of skincare products. For instance, the application would ask for the user's:

- collection name
- skincare products to add or remove

After inputting the information above, the project will display a list of the skincare products that the user has added. 
This project interests me because I enjoy recommending skincare products to my peers, and I believe that it would be a 
convenient way for people to view all the skincare products that they have or to keep record of all the products they
have tried in the past.
