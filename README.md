## Application for Skincare Product Recommendations 


**A brief description**

As an individual with strong interests in skincare, I want to design an application where users can browse a selection 
of skincare products, based on the input given by them. For instance, the application could ask for the user's 
- specific skin type
- type of skincare product that they are searching for
- budget
- preferred brands or brands that they do not like

After inputting the user's concerns, the project will display images of recommended products, along with a short 
description of the product. This project interests me because I enjoy recommending skincare products to my peers, and I 
believe that it would be a convenient way for individuals to create a skincare routine.
