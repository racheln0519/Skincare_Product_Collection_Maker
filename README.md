## Skincare Product Sorter 


**A brief description**

As an individual with strong interests in skincare, I want to design an application where users can input skincare
products and have a sorter create a routine with the products in order. For instance, the application would ask for the 
user's 

- skincare products
- time of day

After inputting the user's information, the project will display a list of the skincare products in a specific order. 
The order will provide the steps needed in doing their routine. For instance, if cleanser, toner, and moisturizer is 
provided, the application would list the following order:

- cleanser
- toner
- moisturizer

The user is expected to follow the routine by using the products in the order specified above. This project interests me 
because I enjoy recommending skincare products to my peers, and I believe that it would be a convenient way for 
people to get step-by-step instructions for a routine based on the products they have.



## User Stories
